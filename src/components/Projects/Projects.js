I worked with a dataset that included both demographic and service-related data, aiming to identify customers at high risk of leaving and to suggest data-driven strategies for improving retention.
       I trained and compared several models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree. Logistic Regression delivered the best results in terms of overall performance, especially for identifying customers who were likely to stay. I also used feature importance analysis to understand the key factors influencing churn, such as the use of fiber optic internet, high monthly charges, and electronic check payments."
